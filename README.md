# ConsoleMapGen

My very old project 2015/16/17 ? Was in love with console gameing at the time so console was meant as output medium, i transformed it a little now, this version should work everywhere, doesnt use windows workarounds to achieve fullscreen max character width/height. Just an experiment if i can make a random map generator, its very ... its got its own style :D, based on perlin noise - creates lakes, spawns rivers that cut through the country and end in ocean/lake/plain. creates mountains with very unusual algorithm.

can be run on linux with 

dotnet run Program.cs > test.txt

with output to file to create interesting text file
